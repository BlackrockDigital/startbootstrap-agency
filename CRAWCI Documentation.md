# The CRAWCI project. Crime rate, Average wages and Cultural Institutions: what relationship?

Simay Guzel 
Elizaveta Siurina

## 1. Introduction

In modern theoretical approaches, the culture is considered as a value, which is connected to the quality of human’s living.  The  cultural  forms  have  been  and  are  still  used  for accomplishment of wider and bigger aims in the education, building a democratic society of strong individuals, achieving progress in all sheares of life. The presence of cultural institutions enriches and raises the quality of life , provides economic  and spiritual  reproduction.

The culture as a resource for development refers to the way of life, the wealth,  the human relationship  with others, including, for example,  labour relationship and conditions.</p>

If labour market conditions are related in an important way to crime, or individual’s intentions to commit criminal acts are altered by economic situation, then one may see the dependency of wages and crimes. At this point we are making an assumption that the level of cultural education is linked both to labour conditions of an individual as well as crime rates. Hence, our hypothesis is that the presence of cultural institutions influences crime rate and amount of salaries.</p>

## 2. Application scenario

CRAWCI aligns data from different sources in order to gain knowledge about the existence of the cultural institutions throughout italiab regions. The project looks at the relationship between the number of cultural institutions, digitalization and the number of crime reports by regions in Italy.
The project aligns 1) the number of theaters; 2)the percentage of internet usage in families; 3) the number of crime reports; 4)the average salary; 5) The density of cultural institutions per square km.  The result will be a presented as an explorable map which allows users to visualize all the data about regions.

### 2.1 How CRAWCI can contribute to E-Governance

Advertisements and promotions among citizens to make an awareness on the importance of the presence of cultural institutions such as theaters where there are not available that can be deduced from the crime rate can be interesting for the municipalities.

  - Increase awareness
  - Opportunities for information sharing
  - Inspire public participation and collaboration  in a way that enable people to both understand what their governments do and to influence its decisions
  - Greater transparency and accountability
  - Support innovation  in processes of governance
  - Bring the delivery of public services to a new level

### D6 (Mashup)

CRAWCI Project, The final dataset, created 15 November 2019
CSV: https://github.com/simayguzel/crawci/blob/master/dataset/crawciopendata.csv
RDF: https://github.com/simayguzel/crawci/blob/master/dataset/dataset.rdf

License: 

Content description: This dataset includes1) the number of theaters; 2)the percentage of internet usage in families; 3) the number of crime reports; 4)the average salary; 5) The density of cultural institutions per square km.  The result will be a presented as an explorable map which allows users to visualize all the data about regions. 

Methodology: The mashup of datasets D1, D2, D4, D5 was done semi-automatically using Python scripts and the library Pandas, which required a CSV version of the datasets as an input. The developed script firstly dropped the unnecessary columns and then the datasets are aligned through the properties "Theaters", "AvarageIncome", "DifuseofInternet", "CriminalReports" and "CulturalInstitutions".

Here is the Python script developed to drop the columns(an example for one of the datasets):

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import csv
df = pd.read_csv('dataset1.csv')
df.head()
to_drop = ['PRAF',
           'RDPR',
           'Data e ora inserimento']
df.drop(to_drop, inplace=True, axis=1)

df.to_csv(r'cleaned-data1.csv', index=False)



```
Here is the Python script developed to align the datasets:
```
import pandas as pd


def Aligner(cleaned-data1,cleaned-data2,outputdata,area):
    a = pd.read_csv(cleaned-data1,encoding='utf-8')
    b = pd.read_csv(cleaned-data2,encoding='utf-8')
    aligned = a.merge(b, on=area)
    aligned.to_csv(outputdata,index=False)
```
### 4. Quality analysis of the datasets 

This section considers the necessary requirements, established according to the "Linee guida per la valorizzazione del patrimonio informativo pubblico" by AGID https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/bozza/aspettiorg.html#qualita-dei-dati). The four characteristics to control the level of information quality are:

**accuracy** (syntactic and semantic) - the data, and its attributes, correctly represent the real value of the concept or event to which it refers;
**coherence** - the data, and its attributes, is not contradictory to other data regarding the context of use of the owner administration;
**completeness** - the data is exhaustive for all its expected values and with respect to the relative entities (sources) that contribute to the definition of the procedure;
**currentness** (or timeliness of updating) - the data, and its attributes, is of the "right time" (it is updated) with respect to the procedure to which it refers.

### 4.2 Juridical and ethical analysis (privacy, licenses, purposes, etc.)

#### Privacy

Although it does not contain any direct reference to natural persons (e.g. name, address, driving license, detailed physical description), D1 includes indirect information from which it could still be possible to trace the individuals, in this case **minors**, referenced. 

This is does not comply with different Italian acts and laws:

- [DECRETO DEL PRESIDENTE DELLA REPUBBLICA 24 giugno 1998, n. 249](http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/1998/07/29/098G0305/sg) In particular art.2 comma 2: "La  comunita'  scolastica  promuove  la solidarieta' tra i suoi
componenti e tutela il diritto dello studente alla riservatezza." and art.2 comma 7: "Gli  studenti  stranieri  hanno  diritto al rispetto della vita culturale  e  religiosa  della  comunita' alla quale appartengono. La scuola  promuove e favorisce iniziative volte alla accoglienza e alla tutela  della loro lingua e cultura e alla realizzazione di attivita' interculturali."

- [DECRETO LEGISLATIVO 30 giugno 2003, n. 196](http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2003/07/29/003G0218/sg) Art. 50 comma 1: "1. Il divieto di cui all'articolo 13 del decreto del Presidente della Repubblica 22 settembre
1988, n. 448, di pubblicazione e divulgazione con qualsiasi mezzo di notizie o immagini
idonee a consentire l'identificazione di un minore si osserva anche in caso di
coinvolgimento a qualunque titolo del minore in procedimenti giudiziari in **materie diverse
da quella penale.**"

Some significant examples are:

* "[...] come nella classe dove essendoci un alunno affetto da ipoacusia; tutta la classe ha voluto integrare il proprio curriculum con l'apprendimento del LIS (linguaggio dei segni) supportati dall'assistente alla comunicazione."
* "Nell'anno scolastico in corso sono stati sospesi due alunni della scuola primaria per lesioni ai compagni."
* "Le rarissime situazioni nelle quali si evidenzia l'assoluta necessita' di 'ripetere l'anno' (quest'anno un alunno diversamente abile di quinta; lo scorso anno due alunni Rom; inseriti solo a meta' anno in quinta; che finalmente avevano cominciato venire a scuola volentieri!)"
* "La scarsa capacita' di concentrazione dei ragazzi e l'assenza delle famiglie; poco inclini ad alzare la voce quando e' necessario; portano al risultato che i ragazzi non ascoltano; a volte non riescono neanche a rimanere seduti al banco."
* "Nel corrente anno scolastico nel nostro istituto ci sono stati solo due alunni non ammessi: un alunno straniero che non ha praticamente frequentato e un altro che non ha raggiunto gli obiettivi minimi previsti."
* "Nel presente anno scolastico non sono stati ammessi alla classe successiva due alunni della scuola primaria [...]. La motivazione delle non ammissioni si puo' riassumere nei seguenti punti: mancato raggiungimento degli obiettivi minimi programmati assenze (non giustificate da un valido motivo) oltre il limite previsto a livello normativo"
* "Se si esclude un'alunna straniera che si e' ritirata per tornare in Romania (a.s. 2015/16), tutti gli alunni della Scuola primaria negli ultimi due anni scolastici sono stati ammessi alla classe successiva."
* "Solo un'alunna delle nostre classi quinte dell'a.s. 2015/16 non e' stata ammessa alla classe successiva nella scuola secondaria di primo grado nel corrente anno scolastico."
* "1 alunna disabile per fermo pedagogico e 4 trasferiti a.s. 2014/15"

We propose three possible solutions:
1. Remove all free-text explanations for school self-evaluation;
2. Provide schools with pre-compiled questionnaire in place of guidelines;
3. Check text semi-automatically before publication (most ideal in order not to loose interesting information, but also most expensive).

#### Licenses

D1, D2, D4.1 and D4.2 (MIUR) are licensed under the Italian Open Data License (IODL) v2.0, which is very similar to a CC-BY 4.0. Each dataset is accompanied by a clear license declaration. However, the whole website is covered by a "All rights reserved" copyright statement, which does not explicitly mentions the exclusion of the contents accompanied by a IODL 2.0 license. 

The metadata of D3 (MiBACT) do not specify a license e.g. by using the property `dcterms:license` (see http://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview/resource/datasetLuoghiDellaCultura.html). The website footer includes a license for all website contents (CC-BY-SA-3.0.) and points to a separate webpage which lists exceptions, among which is our "Luoghi culturali" dataset, licensed under a CC-BY 3.0.

### 4.3 Technical analysis (formats, metadata, URIs, provenance)

1. All MIUR datasets taken into consideration (D1, D2, D4.1 and D4.2) use the following date format: full year plus second half of following year with no white spaces or slashes between the two (e.g. 201617). This makes it difficult for machines as well as humans to clearly identify the nature of these particular pieces of data (i.e. the fact that they represent consecutive years and not year plus month if last two digits go from 1 to 12). Furthermore the datasets cover an academic year, meaning that the data do not cover the period going from e.g. January 2016 to December 2017.  
Durations in CSV could be specified as a time interval according to the standard ISO_8601: YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2016-09-01/2017-08-31).

2. D1 features text in Slovenian (Slovenian schools in Friuli Venezia Giulia express their self-evaluation in Slovenian rather than Italian). Languages should be declared at least in the XML/RDF dataset as shown below.

```xml
<MIUR:MOTIVAZIONEPUNTEGGIOSCUOLA xml:lang="sl">
	[description in Slovenian]
</MIUR:MOTIVAZIONEPUNTEGGIOSCUOLA>
```

3. The XML/RDF version of D1 and D2 makes an incorrect use of namespaces and ontologies, which are declared but not used.

4. In the MIUR page of the csv D1 dataset there is no indication about the encoding of the file (if it's ASCII, ISO-8859-1), despite this is encouraged by the ["Linee guida per la valorizzazione del patrimonio informativo pubblico" by AGID](https://www.agid.gov.it/it/agenzia/stampa-e-comunicazione/notizie/2017/08/03/open-data-online-linee-guida-valorizzazione-del-patrimonio-informativo-pubblico). This problem can create various problems in the automatic computation of the data. In fact, a wrong encoding declaration during the analysis may create incorrect data results (some cells may be skipped for example). After trying multiple encodings, the only one that seemed to work without corrupting, using Python library "csv", was "utf-8-sig" ([see Python documentation about it here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#encodings-and-unicode)). An example of a script using that encoding can be seen in [section 5.1](https://github.com/sebucci/sebucci.github.io/blob/master/readme.md#51-data-processing)

### 4.4 Updating the dataset over time

We do not plan to update SEBuCCI as it takes a picture of a specific school year, namely 2016-2017. However, it would be interesting to create new datasets for the following school years to be able to make comparisons between datasets.

### 4.5 Summary

| Id | Problem description | Severity (1-3) | Type (Syntax/Semantics) | Proposed solution |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| D1, D2, D4.1, D4.2 / Column A | Ambiguous date format used | 1.5 | Syntax | Adopt ISO 8601 date format |
| D1 | Indirect information about individuals | 3 | Semantics, Privacy | Remove information |
| D3, D4.3 | Incorrect information about Sardinia's provinces | 2.5 | Outdated content | Combination of manual and automatic methods to redistribute data in the correct provinces |
| D1 | Encoding of the dataset not specified | 2 | Technical | Include a note on the download page of the dataset stating its encoding |
| D1 | Ambiguity between title and content (school/institutes ID)| 2 | Semantics | Disambiguation through alignment scripts with other datasets |
| D2 | Ambiguity with the content of the cells (-, "Non richiesto") | 2 | Semantics | Our solution was to consider them both as "NO" | 

## 5. Visualization

### 5.1 Data processing

Although the final dataset has been released in RDF format, the CSV has also been made available on the project GitHub repository as it was used to extract the data needed in order to produce the visualization. 

Python was used to process the CSV dataset. Each row of the CSV was converted into a list of dictionaries with the help of the "CSV" library:

```python
def process_data(source_csv_file_path):
    import csv
    data = list()
    with open(source_csv_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as test:  #Notice the utf-8-sig
        processed_data = csv.DictReader(test, delimiter=',')
        for x in processed_data:
            x = dict(x)
            data.append(x)
    return data
 ```
We then developed algorithms to calculate percentages and extract data specifically useful for the final visualization.
Once the final sub-datasets that were used for computation were acquired, we used the JSON Python library to convert them into a json format as it was one of the inputs requested by the visualization library.

```python
import json
def jsonize(data,nome):
    risultatojson = open(nome+".json", "w+")  #automatically creates a json file with the name specified in the input
    json_data = json.dumps(data)  #converts the data into json format
    risultatojson.write(json_data) #writes on the new file the converted data
```

#### 5.1.1 Get school coordinates from address:

In order to get the latitude and longitude of schools knowing their addresses, we employed the following script: [address2latlon.py](https://github.com/sebucci/sebucci.github.io/blob/master/script/address2latlon.py).

It uses the library [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is a client for several popular geocoding web services (under [MIT license](https://github.com/geopy/geopy/blob/master/LICENSE)). Using this library we were able to retrieve geographical coordinates of schools, but only for the province of Bologna, because it has a limiter in usage, so we decided to reduce the set of schools (sebucci is still a demo).

We faced another problem here: according to our dataset we should have 430 schools, but we were able to retrieve only 298 of them. Their addresses are difficult to parse, because they are not well formed.

### 5.2 Handling the visualization (technical description)

In order to visualize the data the following libraries were used:

* **Leaflet.js**: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
* **Chart.js**: Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers and developers.
* **Bootstrap**: Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end component library.

**GEOJSON**: Leaflet makes it possible to draw polygons directly from geojson files:

* Regions: To help us draw regions, data from [Stefano Cudini's repository](https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-geojson-selector/blob/master/examples/italy-regions.json) were used.

* Provinces: To help us draw provinces, data from [Dataninja repository](https://github.com/Dataninja/geo-shapes/tree/master/italy/regions) were used.
**N.B.** Each region is contained in a single json file, except for Sardegna provinces which were not updated to 2017. In order to handle this problem, we retrieved additional data from the ISTAT archive [CONFINI DELLE UNITÀ AMMINISTRATIVE A FINI STATISTICI AL 1 GENNAIO 2018](https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/222527), [CC BY 3.0](https://www.istat.it/it/note-legali).

**Chart.js**
For the visualization of school self-evaluation a specific bar chart was chosen ([MIT license](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/notes/license.html)).

### 5.3 Behind the icons (light bulbs and museum buildings)
The visualization makes use of visual metaphors to synthetically represent the data. 

#### 5.3.1 Cultural institutions
N. of cultural institutions divided by Km^2.

For Italy, each region, each province we established the following threshold:

-one museum icon if < 0.0224 (Italian average presence of cultural institutions/Km^2);
-two museum icons if >= 0.0224 and < 0.0448;
-three museum icons if >= 0.0448.

#### 5.3.2 School building safety certificates
For each school building we calculated the percentage of available certificates (for example if 4 of 8 certificates are available, then the percentage is 50%). 
For each school we calculated the average of percentages of available certificates (for example if a school has two buildings, with 25% and 50% of available certificates respectively, then the final percentage is 37.5%).

For Italy, each region, each province, each school we established the following threshold:

-red light bulb <= 33%;
-yellow light bulb > 33% and <=66%;
-green light bulb > 66%.

## 6. Final considerations

### 6.4 What about our initial questions? 

1. Does the presence of libraries, museums and other cultural institutions in school surroundings impact how schools evaluate their teaching performance? 
2. Do building certifications also play a role in school self-evaluation? 

#### Cultural institutions

By looking at the best provinces for school self-evaluation and cultural institutions per Km^2, we see that only **Rimini** and **Ascoli Piceno** appear on both lists. On this basis, we can state that **having a high number of cultural institutions nearby the school has no apparent relation with student performance**.


In the same way, by looking at the worst provinces for school self-evaluation and cultural institutions per Km^2, we see that only **Rovigo**, **Sassari**, **Nuoro** and **Sud Sardegna** appear on both lists. On this basis, we can state that **having a low number of cultural institutions nearby the school may slightly have a negative influence on student performance**.

In conclusion, **the number of cultural institutions nearby the school very slightly influence student performance**.

#### School safety certificates

By looking at the best provinces on both school self-evaluation and school safety certificates, **Rimini** and **Pordenone** are the only provinces on both lists. We can conclude that, according to our data, **having a good percentage of school safety certificates has no apparent relation with student performance**.

In the same way, by looking at the provinces having the lowest percentage of school safety certificates and the lowest school self-evaluation results, we can see that only **Nuoro**, **Trieste** and **Chieti** are included in both lists. From this, we can state that **having a bad percentage of school safety certificates has no apparent relation with student performance**.

In conclusion, **the percentage of school safety certificates do not have an apparent relation with student performance**.
