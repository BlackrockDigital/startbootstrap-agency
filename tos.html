The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to the TOS.


17. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

(a)	ALL CLAIMS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1) SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (DEFINED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TOS AS A COURT OF LIMITED JURISDICTION THAT MAY ONLY HEAR CLAIMS NOT EXCEEDING $5,000) IF YOUR CLAIMS ARE WITHIN THE COURT'S JURISDICTION. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.

(b)	The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its then-applicable Commercial Arbitration Rules or, as appropriate, its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA's rules are available at http://www.adr.org/. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by a single independent and neutral arbitrator. For any hearing conducted in person as part of the arbitration, you agree that such hearing shall be conducted in San Francisco, California or, if the Consumer Arbitration Rules apply, another location reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances, as determined by the arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator on all matters relating to the Claim shall be final and binding. Judgment on the arbitral award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(c)	WE EACH AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1) SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, ARBITRATION OR OTHER SIMILAR PROCESS. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND AGREE THAT SUCH CLAIM SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. YOU HEREBY SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS AND WAIVE ANY OBJECTION ON THE GROUNDS OF VENUE, FORUM NON-CONVENIENS OR ANY SIMILAR GROUNDS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH CLAIM.

(d)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you and Kanopy may seek injunctive relief and any other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect our intellectual property rights, whether in aid of, pending or independently of the resolution of any dispute pursuant to the arbitration procedures set forth in this Section 17.


18.	LEGAL COMPLIANCE

You represent and warrant that you are not: (a) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (b) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including, but not limited to, the Specially Designated Nationals List.


19.	U.S. GOVERNMENT ENTITIES

The United States Government shall acquire only those rights set forth in the TOS with respect to the such items, and any access to or use of the Service by the United States Government constitutes: (i) agreement by the United States Government that that such items are "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as defined in this section; and (ii) acceptance of the rights and obligations herein.


20.	NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in the TOS, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to the TOS.

22.	GENERAL PROVISIONS

The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Kanopy concerning your access to and use of the Service. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written negotiations and agreements between you and Kanopy with respect to such subject matter. The TOS may not be amended by you except in a writing executed by you and an authorized representative of Kanopy. You may not assign or delegate any right or obligation under the TOS without the prior written consent of Kanopy. The failure of Kanopy to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of the TOS. Any prevention of or delay in performance by Kanopy hereunder due to labor disputes, acts of god, governmental restrictions, enemy or hostile governmental action, fire or other casualty or other causes beyond its reasonable control shall excuse the performance of its obligations for a period equal to the duration of any such prevention or delay.
