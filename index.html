                                            <p>Sharbel was an outstanding student at the American University in Dubai. His soft skills - communication, teamwork, and time management -
                                              complement his strong technical background. His problem formulation and problem solving abilities stand out. His sense of career direction
                                              and professional advancement are clear. </p>

                                              <p>I have known Sharbel for 4 years during my tenure at the American University in Dubai. I taught him a Calculus for Engineering class,
                                                and I supervised him while he tutored at the Mathematics Tutoring Center. Sharbel's intelligence, hard work, and professionalism were
                                                evident and on display in and out of the classroom. In class, he oftentimes posed thought-provoking questions, and his answers
                                                reflected his outstanding analytical abilities. He was one of the few students who managed to earn a full grade (100%) in a demanding
                                                course that has a relatively high failure rate. In addition, Sharbel's work at the Tutoring Center helped display his positive and
                                                respectful attitude, in addition to his willingness to help other students. He proved to be an excellent tutor, and students often
                                                complimented his teaching style, his dedication, and his ability to relay information smoothly and confidently.  </p>

                                                <p>Sharbel is one of the brightest students that I have supervised during the Summer School. He started the project with great energy
                                                  and continued till the end, despite the vagueness and challenges that were faced during the project span. Through day-to-day mentoring,
                                                  I was able to see his team-player qualities while he worked with his teammates. Moreover, Sharbel enjoys collective success. Not only
                                                  was he complimenting his own team, but also he showed remarkable sportsmanship by helping other teams with their business ideas, while
                                                  also accepting criticism from them. Furthermore, his humbleness and friendliness made me enjoy working with him. Finally, the outcome
                                                  was rewarding; he was part of the winning team in the summer school for the social enterprise idea that he pitched about helping
                                                  refugees and locals to integrate. Yet that was not it. rather than abandon the school project after it is done, Sharbel wanted to
                                                  take the idea a step further by applying to the EIT Digital Master School pre-incubator, and he got selected.So if you are looking
                                                  for a brilliant addition to your team, Sharbel is the choice.  </p>

                                              <p>Among my students, Sharbel is definitely one of the most memorable. His energy and participation level during class never
                                                 went down throughout the whole year. He was aware of the trends in technology and innovation, and delivered quality projects
                                                  in the end, making him receive A’s in all of his homeworks and activities. Furthermore, he is very proactive. He would never
                                                   miss a chance to present in class and share knowledge with his colleagues. Characterized by his humble personality, he was
                                                    keen on exchanging constructive feedback with his colleagues and teachers. One of the principles I promote in class is
                                                     "always to be critical to ideas and have a constructive attitude against your friends", and Sharbel worked well with that.
                                                      Finally, Sharbel has a lot of big dreams and surely has the talent to achieve them. </p>

                                              <p>It's a pleasure that I am writing the recommendation for Sharbel. Sharbel is very honest person and very friendly too. I have
                                                 worked with Sharbel and other Student Government officers to organize several events at the American University in Dubai.
                                                 Sharbel is co-operative, hard-working, and punctual. He has the potential to solve any difficult problem that could be faced.
                                                 I would wish him good luck for his bright future. Lastly, people would be very lucky to have him as an employee, friend, and they will enjoy his company.</p>

                                <p>Populism and post-truth politics, which focus on providing false and unbacked claims, have been everlasting problems. With the help of social media,
                                  their effects were amplified. Politicians utilize social media platforms like Twitter to post false facts, exploiting their position and their
                                  numerous followers into spreading ideas that lack evidence.<br/><br/>

                                  In the Social Media course at Aalto University, which aims to tackle problems arising from social media, the teams were asked to engineer
                                  a solution while focusing on the ethical and social responsibility. While the solution could be a Youtube campaign or another social media platform,
                                  our team, The Social Minions, wanted to to focus on designing an open-source Twitter plugin that enables people to back or dispute claims in Tweets,
                                  mainly by providing sources. Users are also allowed to up-vote or down-vote the sources, since even their level of credibility varies.<br/><br/>

                                  The project spanned four months, through which we were working on weekly assignments to progress with our problem, understand it well, and come up
                                  with a solution. Our assignments included blog posts, posters, or even videos, and were collected in a <a href="https://somecse.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
                                  Our Final submission was a video explaining the solution and a
                                  <a href="docs/Social Media Project Report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>. <br/><br/>It is noteworthy that this was one of the smoothest teamwork projects
                                  in which I have been involved. Every member did an awesome job in their own area of expertise, like writing (political) blogs, designing posters and visual mockups, and editing videos.

                                    <strong>Below is a parody that I wrote and recorded for an assignment about presenting the problem in an artistic way. </strong> We were asked to "be creative, even if
                                      [we] want to go as far as writing a poem for about our problem". While a collage, which is eventually what other teams did, would have been sufficient for the assigment,
                                      I wanted to take that extra step and make it fun for everyone, so I did this in 4 days. I felt happy seeing that the work was appreciated and shared,
                                      especially by the professor himself.

                                    I had a lot of fun in this project especially that it unleashes the creativity in students, and each assignment had something unique in which I could practice my interests
                                    and enrich the project.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <strong>Result:</strong> The results were great and we received a grade of 5/5 in the course.

                                But unfortunately, Zuka had to move from her city, Aleppo, on a 20-day journey to Sweden.
                                And none of what she used to do back home is possible to practice anymore...
                                  <p></p>

                                  Above is the story of my cousin who was a living a normal life until she had to leave her country Syria due to the unpleasant situation.
                                  After arriving to Sweden, Zuka faced a lot of barriers hindering her settlement and return to the life she had. She had to wait for a year to get her residence
                                   status to start learning the language, then getting some practical work, then going back on track with a job.
                                  <br/><br/>
                                   With 160,000 people like Zuka arriving only to Sweden in 2015, our team felt that there is a great need to target in our Summer School in Paris,
                                   which was themed around Cyber-Physical Systems, and part of several summer schools held by the EIT Digital Master School. Our project gained attendtion by the summer
                                    school supervisors, since it tackles a huge societal problem.
                                  <br/><br/>
                                  Pal was our solution for refugees to integrte with locals based on sharing their stories. Locals love to help, but find trusting strangers difficult. Pal aims to build trust
                                  by showing that these new-comers are just like the locals, with talents and great potential. The differentiating factor is the societal interaction that Pal provides to
                                  locals, making them already know about the refugee before even meeting them inperson to help them.
                                  <br/><br/>
                                  The name comes from the fact that refugees and locals are like pals (friends), and also serves as an acronym for "Peace and love".
                                  <br/><br/>

                                  <strong>Result:</strong> The Project won the first place in the summer school as the best Entrepreneurial idea. Consequently our team got the chance to pitch the idea in the next year's EIT DIgital Kick-off,
                                   for which I was nominated by my team to present.

                                  I also applied with the project to the EIT Digital ESN (Entrepreneurial Student Network), which is a pre-incubation program that takes promising ideas and helps mature them. I got
                                   selected for the pre-incubation at the Helsinki node at Aalto University. I also decided to take the challenge of making this project my master's thesis topic, where I design
                                   prototypes of the service in addition to performing the user research and usability study.

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Analytics and Visualization of people's tweets and sentiments.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lettucemine2.png" alt="">
                                <p> The Business Development Lab, one of the most memorable courses that I took at KTH in Stockholm, was the birth of this startup idea involving big data, visualization, and social media analytics.
                                  Five months was the time given for each team to found a business from conception to having real partnerships and customers. Having worked on the business model from bottom to top, starting with
                                  the value proposition, to the customer segments and customer relations, to the partnerships and revenue stream, we had a great chance experiencing the startup world with its stressful deadlines,
                                  painful rejections, but joyful partnerships.</p>
                                <p> Our idea was to help data journalists and brand analysts to get better visualized insights from tweets, including which areas of the world are tweeting about a topic, which topic is predicted to trend, as well as the sentiments associated
                                   with the tweets. This enables both journalists to be on the frontline in writing stories and predict potential trends, and englighten brand anaysts with what people feel about their brand. Since we promise that using our service we mine
                                   insights from the pool of big data, we called it "LettuceMine". Moreover, lettuce had a special significance among our team. LettuceMine's business model was based on add-ons, where customers pay for the features they choose from the platform,
                                   as well as choose certain key-terms whose trendability (if it's a term :P) is determined by the service. The theme also expanded to maintaining customer relations by sending our subscribers, whom we called "miners", a weekly "data salad", which is
                                   a collection of trening topics and visualized insights about them.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lettucemine3.png" alt="">
                                <br/>
                                <p>In the end, we agreed on partnership with Gavagai, which provides the sentiment analysis from the tweets we collate. As for the customers, high interests from journalists in Sweden's Aftonbladet and The Local, and brand analysts from Vattenfall.</p>

                                <strong>The idea is pitched in the below commercial I made. I also proudly use my voice-over skills here ;)</strong>
                                <p></p>

                                <br/><br/><br/>

                                <strong>Result:</strong> The startup idea we ended up with not only had great potential but also believing partners and customers, a beta web platform, and a grade of A in the course.
                                Sadly, however, the team had to scatter since the nature of the EIT Digital Master School is that students have different entry and exit universities.

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Mobile Application for Realtime and Asynchronous Voice Messaging.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/oice1.PNG" alt="">
                                <p> During my final year of bachelors, I chose to take a mobile applications course whose project involves building an app.
                                  The course enabled us to come up with any idea and develop it. Hence, I was working on a voice messaging apps that
                                  enables users to communicate in realtime (like a push-to-talk service) or asynchronously if the users are not available
                                  to communicate in realtime. The idea was to have an easy-to-use communication channel for a team of event organisers such as in
                                  my university, where some organisers might still be in class or a meeting and do not prefer to listen to voice commands, and
                                  where actions need to be taken faster than typing the command. The key feature was that messages would be deleted after listened
                                  to, thus reducing the storage burden.</p>

                                <p>This project allowed me to go outside my comfort zone and accept a far-fetched challenge. This was also one of those projects
                                  that did not go smooth; I was slapped on the face in several occasions yet learned a lot of lessons. I learned that I should aim for feature whose implementation
                                  in the project time frame is realistic. Nonetheless, I also learned things that were not taught in class. I got to experience the pain of programming
                                  and getting my hands dirty with code that does not work for many days before the glorious moment happens when I make it work.


                                  The documentaton of the prject can be found <a href="docs/Oice_report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Below are the features that I worked on in the app:

                                <br/>
                                <p> <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> In terms of service design and software engineering, I got the chance to experience a new software development project with a team. Additionally, I was proudly able to develop store a short voice message and play it from the app with the touch and hold control I intended to. I was also happy to learn
                                how the whole system is supposed to work from frontend to backend. I was able to save users who sign up and add them as contacts, after learning and using
                                the then available Parse.com as a Backend-as-a-Service.

                                <br/><br/>

                                <strong>Result:</strong> This project enabled me to sharpen my project management and software engineering skills, as well as learn several  app developlent concepts and techniques that
                                was able to use in later projects.

                                <br/>

                                A year later, I developed the business model around this idea and included the model in my application to the EIT Digital Master School, which contributed to my acceptance. <br/>
